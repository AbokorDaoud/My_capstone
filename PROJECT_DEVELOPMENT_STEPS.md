# My Social Media API Development Journey

## Introduction
I am developing a comprehensive social media platform using Django and Django REST Framework. This document outlines my development process, decisions, and the steps I took to build this application.

## Project Setup Steps

### 1. Initial Setup
1. I created a new Django project called `social_media_api`
2. I set up a virtual environment for dependency management
3. I installed required packages:
   - Django
   - Django REST Framework
   - djangorestframework-simplejwt for JWT authentication
   - Pillow for image handling

### 2. User Management Implementation
1. I extended Django's built-in User model with a UserProfile model
2. I implemented user registration and authentication:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Custom user serialization
   - Profile creation on user registration
3. I added follow/unfollow functionality:
   - Many-to-many relationship for followers
   - Follow status tracking
   - Follow notifications

### 3. Post System Development
1. I created the Post model with features:
   - Text content and optional images
   - Privacy settings (public, followers-only, private)
   - Like system
   - Share counting
2. I implemented post interactions:
   - Like/unlike functionality
   - Comment system
   - Share mechanism
3. I added hashtag support:
   - Automatic hashtag extraction
   - Hashtag model and relationships
   - Post-hashtag associations

### 4. Social Features Integration
1. I developed the notification system:
   - Multiple notification types (likes, comments, follows)
   - Read status tracking
   - Real-time notification delivery
2. I implemented direct messaging:
   - Private conversations between users
   - Message read status
   - Conversation threading
3. I added user mentions:
   - Mention detection in posts
   - Notification generation for mentions
   - User tagging in comments

### 5. Feed and Content Discovery
1. I created the personalized feed:
   - Posts from followed users
   - Chronological ordering
   - Visibility filtering
2. I implemented content discovery features:
   - Hashtag-based search
   - User search
   - Trending posts

### 6. Security Implementation
1. I implemented authentication security:
   - JWT token authentication
   - Password hashing
   - Session management
2. I added permission controls:
   - Object-level permissions
   - User role management
   - Content privacy settings

### 7. Data Management
1. I implemented cascade deletion:
   - User profile deletion handling
   - Associated content cleanup
   - Relationship management
2. I added data validation:
   - Input sanitization
   - File upload validation
   - Content moderation flags

### 8. API Documentation
1. I documented all components:
   - Comprehensive docstrings
   - API endpoint documentation
   - Usage examples
2. I created development guides:
   - Setup instructions
   - Testing procedures
   - Deployment guidelines

## Current Focus
I am currently working on enhancing the cascade deletion system to ensure proper cleanup of user data when profiles are deleted. This includes:
1. Implementing signals for user deletion
2. Managing related content deletion
3. Handling edge cases in social relationships
4. Testing deletion scenarios

## Next Steps
1. Complete cascade deletion implementation
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Implement real-time notifications using WebSockets
4. Add media file optimization
5. Enhance search functionality
6. Deploy to production environment

## Technical Decisions

### Why Django REST Framework?
I chose DRF because it provides:
- Robust serialization system
- Built-in authentication
- Powerful viewsets and routers
- Excellent documentation
- Strong community support

### Why JWT Authentication?
I implemented JWT because it offers:
- Stateless authentication
- Scalability
- Security
- Cross-domain support
- Mobile-friendly implementation

### Database Choices
I used PostgreSQL because it provides:
- Robust relationship handling
- JSON field support
- Full-text search capabilities
- Concurrent user handling
- Data integrity features

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: User Relationships
**Problem**: Managing bidirectional follow relationships
**Solution**: Implemented a many-to-many relationship with through model for additional metadata

### Challenge 2: Cascade Deletion
**Problem**: Ensuring clean deletion of user data
**Solution**: Implementing custom signals and cascade rules

### Challenge 3: Performance
**Problem**: Feed generation for users with many followers
**Solution**: Implemented pagination and optimized queries

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for models and serializers
2. Integration tests for API endpoints
3. Performance testing for data operations
4. Security testing for authentication
5. End-to-end testing for user flows

## Deployment Considerations
1. Environment configuration
2. Database optimization
3. Static and media file handling
4. Security settings
5. Monitoring setup

This document will be updated as the project progresses.
